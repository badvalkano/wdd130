      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever walked in a mall and noticed all the logos, icons and images inthe shops? That’s what I do, I make both designs and illustrations for businesses. A combination of drawing images and designing them effectively is what makes me a graphic designer worth using. Not all graphic designers can illustrate, but when they can that makes them even more valuable and effective. I have made logos, posters, and images for several businesses.  </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>. I intend to give target the men and women who have decided to start their own small businesses. These people will be within 30 to 40 years old and will be supporting their own families. Most will be graduated from high school and some will also be college graduates. They will be new to the business world, truly fresh entreprenuers. My job is to give these greenie businessmen and women the graphics they need to advertise and brand. No brand exists without the graphic that carries it. While user funtion is important, it must also be a good experience that the user will remember and enjoy</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The Website Purpose: 

People will come to my website to have graphics made for various projects that they need done. Whether it’s posters, logos or any type of imaging and advertising, I want to be somebody that they can have confidence in and go to for the designs that they need.  
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="images/graphic.jpg" alt="graphic.jpeg">
        <img src="images/art.jpg" alt="art.jpeg">

      </ul>
      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        The Plan: 

I plan on sending out business cards and posting on social media to get people to visit the website. My hope is that the people will reach out to me for work and I will be able to use the website as both a portfolio and a job opportunity to possibly start up a small graphic design business. It’s important that the website looks aesthetic pleasing or else people will get a bad impression of my designing right of the bat. When it comes to being hired as a graphic designer first impressions are key. It doesn’t matter how smooth of a talker you are, if your portfolio isn’t good enough then people will not want to get you to work for them. It’s key that my very best work is posted on this website and not just some sub par designs that I have made in the past. I may even need to create some brand new designs altogether specifically for this website.  

Conclusion: 

I want to be a simple yet effective small business that is capable of making designs for those who want them. The need for graphic designers in this day and age is increasing and I believe that a company like this could do really well.

      </ul>
      <h3>Function</h3>
      <p>
        The Website Functions: 

The website will be a way for them to contact me and tell me what exactly they want for their designs. Visitors will most likely expect some contact information on the website along with examples of my work so that they can rest assured that I will get the work done in a way that is pleasing to them. It’s important that my website showcases my past work so that people will ask for me. It is necessary that there is my contact information along with past projects that I have done. Most of these projects will need project descriptions that describe the process of creation for all these designs. There will need to be a page centered on displaying previous projects with descriptions. The website must also have all the different projects that I would be prepared to do. Obviously, I have my limitations and I would need to catch up the readers on what I can and can’t do. There would need to be some system for me to chat with those who want projects done and let them know my input on what would look good as well as what I would be willing to do.  

The Website Benefits:

I definitely have a specific style of design and illustration. Those who came to my website will most likely want to have things made in a similar style. Visitors will come to my website to get these specific styles designs rather than another. I will probably be more affordable than any professional graphic design company. I would also be more available to talk with my clients than anybody else. They definitely would need to be informed of my website at first if they were local.  

Comparisions:

I want to have a brand that people will recognize and trust. I know a guy who has a similar website for his designs and illustrations and they look good enough to the point where I’m sure my friend makes lots of clients through his simple business cards that he hands out to people. He is a good example of what I am trying to do with this website.
