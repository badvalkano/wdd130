            <h1>Portfolio</h1>
            <p>I plan on sending out business cards and posting on social media to get people to visit the website. My hope is that the people will reach out to me for work and I will be able to use the website as both a portfolio and a job opportunity to possibly start up a small graphic design business. It’s important that the website looks aesthetic pleasing or else people will get a bad impression of my designing right of the bat. When it comes to being hired as a graphic designer first impressions are key. It doesn’t matter how smooth of a talker you are, if your portfolio isn’t good enough then people will not want to get you to work for them. It’s key that my very best work is posted on this website and not just some sub par designs that I have made in the past. I may even need to create some brand new designs altogether specifically for this website.  

                Conclusion 
                
                I want to be a simple yet effective small business that is capable of making designs for those who want them. The need for graphic designers in this day and age is increasing and I believe that a company like this could do really well.
