            <p>The Website Functions 

                The website will be a way for them to contact me and tell me what exactly they want for their designs. Visitors will most likely expect some contact information on the website along with examples of my work so that they can rest assured that I will get the work done in a way that is pleasing to them. It’s important that my website showcases my past work so that people will ask for me. It is necessary that there is my contact information along with past projects that I have done. Most of these projects will need project descriptions that describe the process of creation for all these designs. There will need to be a page centered on displaying previous projects with descriptions. The website must also have all the different projects that I would be prepared to do. Obviously, I have my limitations and I would need to catch up the readers on what I can and can’t do. There would need to be some system for me to chat with those who want projects done and let them know my input on what would look good as well as what I would be willing to do.  
                
                The Website Benefits 
                
                I definitely have a specific style of design and illustration. Those who came to my website will most likely want to have things made in a similar style. Visitors will come to my website to get these specific styles designs rather than another. I will probably be more affordable than any professional graphic design company. I would also be more available to talk with my clients than anybody else. They definitely would need to be informed of my website at first if they were local.
