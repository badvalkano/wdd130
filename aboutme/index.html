    <h2>Seth Valentine</h2>
    <p>I'm a Graphic Design Major from Kaysville, Utah. I'm currently living in Rexburg and I'm really enjoying the college life. 
        I work at a custom tee shop for the university. Attatched is an image of me on my mission in Region Eight 
        of the Philippines. 
    </p>
    <p>I'm excited to learn about web design and code in this class, I have two older brothers that are really
        into coding and it sounds awesome. I don't really have any experience in this area so it will be interesting for me to learn
        all this. </p>
